        <h1 id="dabi-ecosystem">Dabi Ecosystem</h1>
        <h2 id="what-is-the-dabi-ecosystem">What is the Dabi Ecosystem?</h2>
        <p>The Dabi Ecosystem is a modular, multi-surface automation and AI
          interaction platform designed to operate across live streams, chat
          platforms, and web-based surfaces. It provides a shared foundation for
          real-time event handling, AI-driven interaction, and cross-platform
          integration, allowing multiple independent components to behave as a
          single cohesive system.</p>
        <p>At the center of the ecosystem is “Dabi” - a persistent AI agent that
          serves as the primary interface between the system and its users. Rather
          than existing as a single application, Dabi can present itself across
          multiple platforms, including Twitch, Discord, and standalone web
          interfaces, adapting its behavior and communication style to the surface
          it inhabits.</p>
        <p>In addition to text and voice-based interaction, Dabi can also be
          embodied visually, controlling an on-screen avatar that reflects system
          state and provides a tangible sense of presence during live
          interactions.</p>
        <h2 id="why-it-exists">Why it exists</h2>
        <p>Dabi was created as a deliberate learning project. It provided an
          opportunity to explore LLM interaction, real-time systems, and platform
          integration through a single evolving system. It is the largest personal
          project I have undertaken, and its public nature introduced real
          constraints around reliability, consistency, and clarity of design.</p>
        <p>While the project began without a rigid upfront plan, its continued
          development required me to regularly explain design decisions and
          trade-offs in real time. That process surfaced assumptions, limitations,
          and architectural pressures that would not have been visible through
          experimentation alone.</p>
        <h2 id="core-capabilities">Core Capabilities</h2>
        <p>Depending on the surface it is operating on, Dabi can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ingest events from Twitch and Discord</li>
          <li>Receive REST API calls externally with API keys</li>
          <li>Respond to text and speech inputs</li>
          <li>Generate text or speech outputs</li>
          <li>Interpret images and visual context</li>
          <li>Perform moderation and automation actions</li>
          <li>Invoke external tools and services</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
        <p>The Dabi Ecosystem was hosted on a Raspberry Pi and ran continuously
          as a collection of multi-process Python applications. A primary process
          was responsible for orchestrating supporting services and managing
          inter-process communication via queues.</p>
        <p>Core logic and decision-making initially lived in a central
          application, while platform-specific integrations (such as Discord and
          Twitch) were handled by dedicated processes. This approach enabled rapid
          experimentation and isolated failures but gradually introduced tight
          coupling between responsibilities.</p>
        <h2 id="status---archived-phase-1-complete">Status - Archived: (Phase 1
          complete)</h2>
        <p>The current version of the Dabi Ecosystem is intentionally archived
          after completing its initial exploratory phase.</p>
        <p>Over time, the system evolved from a single interactive agent into a
          collection of services handling real-time events, AI inference, platform
          integrations, and presentation. While this enabled rapid
          experimentation, it also blurred boundaries between experimentation,
          production usage, and platform responsibilities.</p>
        <p>At this point, continuing development would have increased complexity
          without improving clarity. Rather than incrementally refactoring a
          system that had reached its architectural limits, the project was paused
          to allow for a redesign based on real-world usage and experience.</p>
        <h2 id="technical-observations">Technical Observations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Rapid iteration is effective for uncovering unknown constraints, but
            becomes counterproductive with enough time and complexity.
            <ul>
              <li>Early changes improved understanding quickly. Later changes spent
                more time working within existing behaviour rather than learning or
                adding new information.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Infrastructure constraints (cost, hardware, latency) meaningfully
            shape architecture decisions and cannot be treated as an afterthought.
            <ul>
              <li>Cost constraints drove the decision to run on fixed local hardware,
                turning abstract limits into concrete design boundaries.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Knowing when to stop building is as important as knowing how to
            continue.
            <ul>
              <li>The decision to pause was driven by a decreasing rate of learning
                rather than system failure.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
